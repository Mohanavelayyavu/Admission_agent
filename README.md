## 🎓 About the Project

The **College Admission Agent** is an intelligent virtual assistant developed to streamline the admission process in educational institutions. Built using IBM's cutting-edge technologies—**Watson Assistant**, **Watsonx Granite models**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**—this chatbot offers accurate, real-time responses to a wide range of admission-related queries.

It is capable of answering:

- 📘 Course options based on interests or qualifications  
- 🧾 Detailed eligibility criteria by category or academic background  
- 📅 Admission deadlines, counseling dates, and document requirements  
- 💰 Tuition, hostel fees, and scholarships  
- 📊 College- and category-wise cutoff marks  
- 📂 Information from documents like brochures, PDFs, and CSVs using RAG  

By integrating **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, the assistant retrieves contextual answers from uploaded documents, enhancing accuracy beyond static FAQ-style bots. Combined with **Watsonx Granite**, it understands complex queries, generates natural responses, and scales seamlessly for institutional use.
